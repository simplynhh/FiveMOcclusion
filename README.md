# FiveMOcclusion

This is working files for audio occlusion for interior for FiveM. 

Importing these files in to the game will most likely not work, since this interior might not be in your server.

Your own files needs be to be signed on CodeWalker in order for the occlusion to work, if not your server will crash with the resource.
